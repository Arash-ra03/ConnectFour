Connect Four is a two-player game with perfect information for both sides, meaning that nothing is hidden from anyone.

# AI Implemention
In this project I've implemented AI agent using ***minimax*** and ***alpha-beta pruning*** algorithm.<br />
Also depth of game tree could be changed which changes AI agent difficulty level.

# Q-Learning Implemention
Another approach to have a AI agent is trying to train AI agent with Q-Learning algorithm.
This agent has trained itself 3000000 times but due to large number of states that Connect Four has, it doesn't choose the most intelligent move.<br />
Q-table is available in ***agent1.txt***
